This is an implementation of the Khachiyan algorithm for computing Minimum Volume Enclosing Ellipsoids
of a list of points.  I created this because I couldn't find a suitable implementation in a language other
than Matlab, so I decided to re-implement in Haskell.

This implementation is primarily for my usage in a research project, so at least at first, the included 
functions in this module may be somewhat random-looking.
